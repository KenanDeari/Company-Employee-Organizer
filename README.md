## Overview

This application is a employee directory based in React. This task required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events to create a functional user experience.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
